User and User-Group Management System.

Assessment Excercise:

Development Task

In the following tasks, we emphasize maintainability in code structure, a good database design, performance, and scalability.

The tasks are intentionally very open to interpretation and execution. When completed, please submit the code and database structure via GitHub

 

Task 1

Create a database using code first. (SQL database)

A user should be able to appear in multiple groups, and conversely, there should be multiple users in a group.

Each Group should have multiple permissions (Users, Groups, Permissions)

(You can make up the permissions names e.g. Level 1, Level 2 etc. and group Names)

 

Task 2

Create a simple web service that supports user management. (Add, Remove, Update)

Add some endpoints for user count and number of users per group count.

The .NET framework or .NET Core should be used.

 

Task 3

Create a web interface where users can be added, edited, and deleted.

The visual aspect is not important.

Use the Web Api that you created in Task 2

The .NET framework or .NET Core should be used.

 

Extra Points :

Add some Unit tests and Integration Tests

We should also be able to pull the project from Github and deploy it to our local machine.
